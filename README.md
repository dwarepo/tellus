# Tellus Network Graph Demo
This small rust program discovers graph-datastructures
as the data-backbone of the tellus registry and network-/cloud-matching.

## What does it do?
It builds a graph out of network offerings defined in the [csv](./test_networks.csv)
and returnes the needed offerings for the shortest path based on ``bandwidth`` and ``cost``.

You also get a graphviz diagram of the network graph in order to visualize the offerings:
![./test_networks.csv.png](./test_networks.csv.png)

## Handling
In order to build the project run:
```bash
  docker build -t graph-demo . -f ./Containerfile
```
Running the project:
```bash
  docker run -it --rm graph-demo
  # with custom query
  docker run -it --rm graph-demo /demo/graph WOB1 Trumpf cost
```
### Parameter Table
